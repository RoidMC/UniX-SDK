## Attribution Requirements

### 1. Visual Attribution

Any application, game, or software product that incorporates or uses the UniX SDK must include the following attribution in at least one of the following locations:

- Application startup screen or splash screen
- About section or credits screen
- Settings or configuration screen
- Documentation or help files

The attribution must include the text:

```
Powered by UniX SDK
```

### 2. Attribution Display Requirements

The attribution must be:

- Clearly visible to end users
- In a readable font size (minimum 8pt or equivalent)
- Displayed for a reasonable duration if shown on a splash screen
- Not obscured by other elements

### 3. Logo Usage (Optional)

If you choose to display the UniX SDK Logo (the ‚ÄúLogo‚Äù) in your product, you must strictly comply with the following terms:

3.1 Basic Requirements

- Use ‚Äã‚Äãonly the standard Logo‚Äã‚Äã (PNG/SVG) from the official UniX SDK [website](www.roidmc.com) or authorized channels. No modifications allowed.
- For any questions, adjustment requests, or clarification on display rules, please feel free to contact **hi@roidmc.com** we will respond promptly.

3.2 Display Rules

- The logo is displayed at an appropriate size and resolution
- The logo is not modified, distorted, or altered in any way
- The logo is not used in a way that suggests endorsement of your product by UniX SDK creators

3.3 Prohibited Uses  

Unless you have explicit prior written authorization from RoidMC Studios‚Äã‚Äã (via approval at hi@roidmc.com), you may not use the Logo in these scenarios :

1.  Implied Affiliation with RoidMC
- Claim/suggest your product is ‚Äúofficially developed by,‚Äù ‚Äúpartnered with,‚Äù or ‚Äúendorsed by‚Äù RoidMC Studios (e.g., app store descriptions, website headers).
- Use the Logo to imply a direct relationship with RoidMC (e.g., product names like ‚ÄúRoidMC Helper‚Äù).

2.  Commercial Exploitation
- Use the Logo in ads, promotions, or sales materials to drive user acquisition/revenue (e.g., social media ads, email campaigns).
- Feature the Logo in third-party content (blogs, tutorials, videos) to market your product (e.g., ‚ÄúPowered by UniX SDK - download here‚Äù).

3. Unauthorized Modification or Misrepresentation
- Modify the Logo (colors, proportions, design) to mimic RoidMC‚Äôs official versions.
- Combine the Logo with other brands/logos as a joint identifier (e.g., ‚ÄúYourApp √ó UniX SDK‚Äù).

4. Misuse in Derivatives or Third-Party Platforms
- Use the Logo as a primary identifier for plugins, modules, or extensions based on UniX SDK.
- Display the Logo on non-technical platforms (e.g., corporate websites, investor pages) for brand association.

3.4 Ownership & Liability

- Logo IP (copyright, trademarks) belongs to RoidMC Studios. This grants you a ‚Äã‚Äãlimited, non-transferable display right only‚Äã‚Äã.
- Logo use does NOT mean RoidMC Studios endorses your product. We‚Äôre not liable for your product‚Äôs issues.

3.5 Breach Consequences

Violations (e.g., modified Logo, forbidden use) may result in:

- Removal demand within 7 days;
- Logo use authorization termination;
- Compensation for reputational/damages (incl. legal fees).

### 4. Exemptions  

Technical limitations exemptions for ‚Äã‚Äãvisual text attribution‚Äã‚Äã (e.g., "Powered by UniX SDK") require:

- You obtain ‚Äã‚Äãprior written approval‚Äã‚Äã from UniX SDK copyright holders;
- A third-party technical audit confirms ‚Äã‚Äãimpossibility‚Äã‚Äã of adding the text (e.g., game UI size/system limits prevent custom text elements).

Note‚Äã‚Äã: This exemption ‚Äã‚Äãonly waives the requirement to add visual text‚Äã‚Äã in your product‚Äôs UI. MPL-2.0 obligations for the UniX SDK code (e.g., retaining copyright notices) still apply.

## Technical Limitations and Exemptions

If ‚Äã‚Äãobjective technical obstacles‚Äã‚Äã (e.g., extremely small app interface size, system restrictions preventing new interface elements) prevent you from displaying attribution as described above, you may apply for an exemption:

### 1. Written Permission

Exemptions to these attribution requirements may be granted with explicit written permission from the copyright holders of the UniX SDK.

### 2. Technical Limitations

If technical limitations prevent the display of the attribution as specified, alternative arrangements may be made by contacting the copyright holders.

### 3. Termination Mechanism (Aligned with MPL-2.0)

If you ‚Äã‚Äãmaterially breach‚Äã‚Äã your obligations under this document (e.g., deleting the original LICENSE file, altering copyright notices), and fail to cure the breach within ‚Äã‚Äã30 days‚Äã‚Äã of receiving written notice, the UniX SDK Copyright Holder may:

- Terminate your license to use the UniX SDK;
- Require you to remove or recall infringing distributions;
- Pursue legal action for infringement (including claims for damages).

## Relationship to MPL-2.0

These attribution requirements are **integral to the exercise of copyright** under MPL-2.0 Section 2 (Grant of Copyright License). Compliance is **a precondition** for the license grant. Any breach of attribution requirements shall **automatically terminate** all rights granted under MPL-2.0.
